# Contract libs

This repository contains a set of Solidity contracts that can be used across contracts for purposes such as verifying signatures, protecting contracts against reentrancy attacks, and a library for managing the ownership of a contract.

## About this repo

### Structure

It is a hybrid [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) repo that also requires [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/index.html) to run Solidity tests powered by the [ds-test library](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-test/).

> To install Foundry, please follow the instructions [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html).

### Run tests

- Solidity tests are included in the `foundry` folder in the `test` folder.

### Example of Foundry/Forge commands

```shell
forge build
forge test
forge test -vv
forge tree
```

### Example of Hardhat commands

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
